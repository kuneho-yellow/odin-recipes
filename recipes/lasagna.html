        <h4>A Traditional Lasagna With Bolognese Sauce</h4>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp / 2 ounces / 60g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 tbsp / 1.25 ounces / 35g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups / 700ml milk</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Pinch of grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 pounds / 900g lasagna noodles </li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for greasing pasta</li>
            <li>1.5 quarts / 1.5L warm Bolognese sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces / 85g Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparing the Béchamel Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat. Do not allow it to brown.</li>
            <li>Add flour and whisk to form a paste. Continue to cook, stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add milk in a thin, steady stream or in increments, whisking thoroughly to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get very thin once all the milk is added.</li>
            <li>Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until sauce is just thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Whisk in nutmeg. If any lumps form, simply whisk thoroughly to remove them and smooth out sauce, or use a hand blender or countertop blender if lumps are particularly large or tough.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking the Pasta</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta, working in batches if necessary, until al dente.</li>
            <li>Use a spider or mesh strainer to transfer immediately to a large ice bath to cool.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta well, then rub each sheet lightly on both sides with vegetable oil to prevent sticking..</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembling and Baking the Lasagna</h3>
        <ol>   
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>    
            <li>Grease a 9- by 13-inch baking dish with butter.</li>
            <li>Spoon a thin, even layer of Bolognese sauce on bottom of baking dish</li>
            <li>Lay down a layer of lasagna noodles. It's okay if they overlap somewhat, but you can cut any sheets that are too large to avoid excessive doubling up.</li>
            <li>Top pasta with another thin layer of Bolognese sauce (thin enough that you can see the pasta through it in some spots).</li>
            <li>Drizzle a small amount of the béchamel sauce all over the Bolognese sauce, then top with grated Parmigiano Reggiano.</li>
            <li>Repeat this layering process with pasta, Bolognese, béchamel, and grated cheese until baking dish is full; this should be about 6 layers.</li>
            <li>Finish with a top layer of pasta, then coat that with an even layer of the remaining béchamel sauce. Grate a final generous amount of cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Bake lasagna until bubbling and browned on top, about 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let rest 10 minutes, then serve. </li>
        </ol>
