        <h4>Tender and Juicy Grilled Chicken Breast</h4>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ tsp paprika</li>
            <li>½ tsp red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>5 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the grill</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped Italian parsley leaves, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a kitchen mallet to pound the chicken until it’s evenly flattened to about ½-inch.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the Italian seasoning, paprika, red pepper flakes (if using), garlic, lemon zest and juice.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken well all over with salt.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the bowl with the marinade and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grates and preheat your gas grill or an indoor griddle to medium.</li>
            <li>Arrange the chicken in one single layer over the heated surface.</li>
            <li>Grill for about 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches somewhere between 155°F and 160°F.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large plate and immediately tent a large piece of foil loosely over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Allow to rest, covered, until its internal temperature reaches 165°F, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
